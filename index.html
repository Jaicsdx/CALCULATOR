<!--Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
Do not worry about wiring up the JS just yet.
There should also be a display for the calculator. Go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers so it looks correct.
Add a “clear” button. -->
